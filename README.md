# Effortless Eventz by Algo Clan
## Introduction
 It is an Event Management website to make the tasks of organisers easier by providing exemplary services ranging from designing, planning, execution to publicising events.
 We have considered some popular corporate, private and fundraising events. For these events, we take input from the organiser such as name, email address, name of event, type of event, guest list, budget, date and venue. From these data, we mail them what they are looking for, be it sponsors, publicising events and so on. You can also design your Invites here. If provided email of guest list, we will also send those invites to them with your note.
 
 So what are you waiting for? Grab your PC and start planning from your room!
